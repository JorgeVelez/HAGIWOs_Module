# 6ch Sequencer

！！ Note ！！

- **This board has never actually been manufactured!** I will get feedback and improve it.
- Footprints such as POTs have been replaced with pin headers to accommodate easily available panel-mounted components.
- Kicad's error checking may show unconnected, but you are probably fine. 
- See the HAGIWO website for the Arduino code.
- Files for the panel will be created as needed.
