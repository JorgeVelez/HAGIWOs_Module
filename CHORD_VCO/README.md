# CHORD VCO
This is a PCB version of the CHORD VCO designed by HAGIWO.
I actually manufactured it with JLCPCB and assembled it, and it works.

！！ Note ！！
- There is no control board in this project. The hardware should be mounted and wired to the panel.
See HAGIWO's original schematic for details.
- I will get feedback and improve it.
- See the HAGIWO website for the Arduino code.
