# HGIWOs_Module

The purpose of this is to PCB the project that HAGIWO is working on.
The Kicad project files, including the circuit and panel designs, are now available.
I'm just starting to learn more about circuit design, so if there are any issues with the design or the circuit itself, please let me know immediately!

！！ Note ！！

- The HAGIWO project is designed to fit into a 6HP, but the PCB width may be larger based on Eurorack standards.
- Please note that there is no guarantee for the PCB production itself, as there are few actual PCBs that have been produced and verified.
- Please note that there is no guarantee for the PCB production itself.
- I won't go into the code here, you can find it on the HAGIWO website.

## 4chSampler
- It was manufactured with jlcPCB and actually worked fine. However, there are a few problems such as unconnected GND and misplaced mounting holes.
- Since I used a momentary switch (tact switch) for the switch, I modified the HAGIWO code slightly. Please check the .ino file in my repository.
