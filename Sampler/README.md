# Sampler

！！ Note ！！

- **This board has never actually been manufactured!** I will get feedback and improve it.  
- The SP3T switch in the original schematic has been changed to SPTD due to availability issues.
- Footprints such as POTs have been replaced with pin headers to accommodate easily available panel-mounted components.
- See the HAGIWO website for the Arduino code.
