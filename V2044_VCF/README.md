# V2044 VCF
This is a PCB version of the V2044 VCF designed by HAGIWO.
This VCF uses the same 2044 IC used in KORG PLYSIX.A simple but effective filter.
The circuit diagram is based on HAGIWO's original.
I actually manufactured it with JLCPCB and assembled it, and it works.

！！ Note ！！
- For the v2044 IC chip itself, I used the Coolaudio reissue version.
- The v2044 package is SOP16, and only this part requires surface mount technology. (Might be easier than you think!)
- See HAGIWO's original schematic for details.
- I will get feedback and improve it.
- See the HAGIWO website for the Arduino code.
